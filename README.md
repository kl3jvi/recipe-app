Recipe App 
=================

A recipe app illustrating Android development best practices with Android Jetpack.

Recipe App is currently under heavy development.
Note that some changes (such as database schema modifications) are not backwards
compatible and may cause the app to crash. In this
case, please uninstall and re-install the app.

Introduction
------------

Android Jetpack is a set of components, tools and guidance to make great Android apps. They bring
together the existing Support Library and Architecture Components and arrange them into four
categories:

Recipe app demonstrates utilizing these components to create a simple android app.

Libraries Used
--------------
* [Foundation][0] - Components for core system capabilities, Kotlin extensions and support for
  multidex and automated testing.
  * [AppCompat][1] - Degrade gracefully on older versions of Android.
  * [Android KTX][2] - Write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
  * [Test][4] - An Android testing framework for unit and runtime UI tests.
* [Architecture][10] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
  * [Data Binding][11] - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
  * [Lifecycles][12] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
  * [LiveData][13] - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  * [Navigation][14] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
  * [Room][16] - Access your app's SQLite database with in-app objects and compile-time checks.
  * [ViewModel][17] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
     asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
  * [WorkManager][18] - Manage your Android background jobs.
* [UI][30] - Details on why and how to use UI Components in your apps - together or separate
  * [Animations & Transitions][31] - Move widgets and transition between screens.
  * [Fragment][34] - A basic unit of composable UI.
  * [Layout][35] - Lay out widgets using different algorithms.
* Third party and miscellaneous libraries
  * [Glide][90] for image loading
  * [Hilt][92]: for [dependency injection][93]
  * [Kotlin Coroutines][91] for managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks

Upcoming features
-----------------
Updates will include incorporating additional Jetpack components and updating existing components
as the component libraries evolve.

Interested in seeing a particular feature of the Android Framework or Jetpack implemented in this
app? Please open a new [issue](https://github.com/kl3jvi/recipe-app/issues).

Android Studio IDE setup
------------------------
For development, the latest version of Android Studio is required. The latest version can be
downloaded from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/).

This app uses [ktlint](https://ktlint.github.io/) to enforce Kotlin coding styles.
Here's how to configure it for use with Android Studio (instructions adapted
from the ktlint [README](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint/blob/master/README.md)):

- Close Android Studio if it's open

- Download ktlint using these [installation instructions](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint/blob/master/README.md#installation)

- Apply ktlint settings to Android Studio using these [instructions](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint/blob/master/README.md#-with-intellij-idea)

- Start Android Studio


Non-Goals
---------
The focus of this project is on Android Jetpack and the Android framework.
Thus, there are no immediate plans to implement features outside of this scope.
